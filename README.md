# Willow Seed

> Plant this. Everything grows from here.

## Why This Exists

I am building this so my daughters can grow up in a world where technology helps them think instead of thinks for them.

That's it. That's the whole reason.

Everything else—the architecture, the governance, the session consent model, the local-first design—exists in service of that single statement.

I want them to inherit tools, not traps.

## What Willow Is

Willow is a local-first AI operating system. One node. Your data stays on your machine. The AI listens, helps you understand yourself, and gets out of the way.

**Local-first** means your thoughts belong to you. Your journal entries, your notes, your conversations—they live on your device, not in someone else's cloud. They cannot be sold. They cannot be used to train models you didn't consent to. They cannot disappear when a company changes its terms of service.

**Session consent** means permission expires when you close the app. Every time you open it, it asks: "May I access your journal today?" You say yes or no. When you close it, that permission is gone. Real consent. Not "agree once and we own everything forever."

**Gets out of the way** means the AI is not trying to maximize your engagement. It is not trying to keep you in the app. It is not optimizing for metrics that have nothing to do with your wellbeing. It helps you think, and then it leaves.

## The Problem

The current model is broken.

You open an app. You agree to terms you will never read. The app now owns everything you put into it—forever. Your data trains their models. Your attention becomes their product. Your thoughts become their property.

And when you try to leave? Your data stays. Or it disappears. Or it's locked behind exports that don't actually work. Or it's sold to the next company that acquires them.

**Consent is not real when it's "agree once, forever."**

**Ownership is not real when you can't take your data with you.**

**Privacy is not real when your journal lives in someone else's building.**

This is not sustainable. This is not healthy. This is not what technology should be.

## What Willow Changes

**Your data lives on your machine.** Not in our cloud. Not in anyone's cloud. On your device. You can back it up. You can export it. You can delete it. It's yours.

**Consent is session-based.** When you open the app, it asks for permission. When you close the app, that permission expires. Tomorrow it will ask again. That's real consent.

**The AI helps you think, not for you.** It's a tool for reflection, not a replacement for judgment. It helps you see patterns, ask better questions, understand yourself. Then it steps back.

**No engagement optimization.** We are not trying to keep you in the app. We are not measuring time-on-platform. We are not A/B testing notifications to maximize opens. If the app helps you and then you close it, that's success.

**Open architecture.** The code is open. The governance framework is public. Other developers can build apps on Willow. The system belongs to the people who use it.

## Why "Seed"

This repository is the minimal bootstrap—the seed that starts a Willow node.

The seed is small by design. It does not contain the full journal app. It does not contain the faculty system. It does not contain everything Willow will become.

It contains enough to grow.

When you plant it, you get:
- A node that runs locally
- Session-based consent controls
- A space that is yours

Everything else you add by choice.

## What's Not Ready Yet

The journal is still being built. That's the heart of Willow—the app that lets you write, reflect, and have conversations with an AI that actually listens.

We are not shipping the door without the room behind it.

When the journal is ready, the seed will work on the first try. Until then, this repo exists as a placeholder. A promise. A map of what's coming.

## For My Daughters

When you are old enough to read this, here is what I want you to know:

Technology should serve you. Not the other way around.

Your thoughts are yours. Your memories are yours. Your journals, your notes, your late-night conversations with an AI trying to help you figure something out—those belong to you.

No company should own them. No algorithm should optimize them. No terms of service should claim them.

I built this because I believe you deserve tools that respect you. That listen when you need to think out loud. That help you understand yourself. That get out of the way when the work is done.

I built this because the world you are growing up in treats attention as a resource to extract and data as a commodity to sell.

That is not the only way to build technology.

This is another way.

**Tools, not traps.**

**Consent that means something.**

**Data that belongs to the people who create it.**

I hope by the time you read this, you will have options I did not. I hope other people will have built systems like this. I hope "local-first" and "session consent" and "sovereign data" are not radical ideas but basic expectations.

But if they are not—if the world still looks like it does now—then plant this seed.

It grows into something that respects you.

## Plant It

```bash
python seed.py
```

No dependencies required. Stdlib only. Consent gates before every action.

See [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for the manual path and app development guide.

## Technical Details

For developers who want to understand what's under the hood:

**Portless MCP server.** Willow runs as a stdio subprocess that Claude Code connects to directly. No HTTP. No exposed ports. No supervisor. The server (`sap/sap_mcp.py`) exposes 44 tools for knowledge, inference, task dispatch, and file intake.

**SAFE authorization.** Every agent holds a signed folder on disk. The SAP gate checks: folder exists → manifest present → `.sig` present → `gpg --verify` passes. Any failure → deny + log. Revoke an agent by deleting its folder. The filesystem is the ACL.

**Two storage layers.**
- *SOIL* — SQLite per collection. Local, always available, no dependencies.
- *LOAM* — Postgres via Unix socket. Knowledge graph: atoms, entities, edges.

**Dual Commit governance.** AI proposes, human ratifies. Nothing writes to the knowledge graph without explicit approval. Authorization is checked on every call — not cached, not assumed.

**Free fleet fallback.** When local models (Ollama) are unavailable, inference routes to Groq → Cerebras → SambaNova using keys from `credentials.json`. All three offer free tiers.

## The Library Is Always On Fire

Communities are held together by the stories they tell about themselves.

But stories need a place to live. And if that place is owned by someone who can delete it, sell it, or disappear it when the business model changes—then the stories are already ash.

Willow exists because the library is always on fire.

This is how we build things that survive it.
